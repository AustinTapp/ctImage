To get the MICCAI final model, it is necessary to download the model from Git.


The file size is quite large, about 270mb. However, Github seems to have an issue when trying:

wget https://github.com/downloads/user/repository/filename



Instead, go to: https://downgit.github.io/#/home and download by entering the url: https://github.com/cuMIP/ctImage/blob/main/MiccaiFinalModel.dat



Alternatively, the model can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zu02D4yMeUZJGVPY-o2jIK_WmVtAn3GM/view?usp=sharing
